Ingredients:
 - 4 pounds pork ribs
 - 3/4 cup brown sugar
 - 1 1/2 teaspoon salt
 - 1 tablespoon garlic powder
 - 1 tablespoon paprika
 - 1/2 teaspoon pepper
 - 2 cups barbeque sauce (Baby Rays is good)

Directions:
 1. preheat oven to 300
 2. peel off tough membrane that covers bony side of ribs
 3. mix sugar and spices
 4. apply sugar rub to both sides of ribs
 5. lay ribs on tin foil (2 layers) and fold and crimp
    foil to seal
 6. place on baking sheet and bake for 2 to 3 hours. 
    (I usually start checking at about 1 1/2 hours to
     see if ribs are starting to come away from bone.
     After 3 hours I would make an experimental cut 
     and that should tell you if it's done to your liking.)
 7. remove from oven and heat broiler
 8. cut ribs into serving sizes
 9. arrange on pan with bony side up and coat with sauce
 10.broil for a couple minutes then turn over and coat the
    other side and broil it for a couple minutes
